# gcp-api-gateway-tests

This was a project to understand how api gateway works and the
authentication as well, so any request that has been done with a
jwt authenticate by gcp can comunicate with others services like
cloud run or functions apis, using github actions as pipeline
with terraform to upload any new version of apis authentication,
gateway or jwt generator.
